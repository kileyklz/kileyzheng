        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        Turtle Island Charity is a community-led organization rooted in Indigenous knowledge and values. It supports
        Indigenous youth, families, and communities through education, mentorship, and wellness programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        When we began working with Turtle Island Charity, their website lacked visual clarity, intuitive structure,
        and accessibility. The design did not reflect the warmth, energy, or professionalism of the work they were doing
        on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
        The goal was to redesign the website to better reflect their mission of "community care through community care,"
        while also improving usability, navigation, and storytelling for donors, volunteers, and the community.
        </p>

      <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        As part of a five-member consulting group in TechConnect, three of which (including myself) took part on the full redesign of Turtle Island Charity’s website. While the project was a 
        team effort, I took a role across multiple stages—from initial research to final implementation. We began with exploring best practices for 
        donation-based websites, analyzing site speed, and evaluating payment processors to ensure a smooth and secure donation experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing from this research, we created the updated information architecture and user flow, and developed wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes 
        to guide the layout and structure. We also maintained regular communication with the client, applying a design thinking approach to ensure that their voice and 
        goals were reflected in every iteration. The final website was fully rebuilt and launched using Wix, aligning with both the organization’s needs and their values.

      <p>This research played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of our project, as the selected payment processor would directly influence both the 
        functionality and design of the donation page. It was essential to understand each platform's integration options, user flow, branding flexibility, 
        and transaction fees in order to make an informed decision that aligned with both user expectations and the organization’s operational needs. </p>
        
      <p>The client ultimately selected PayPal Donations for Nonprofits as the payment processor. This choice meant that the donation experience would occur on an 
        external PayPal-hosted page, rather than through an embedded donation form on the charity’s own site. As a result, our design decisions had to account for this 
        redirect-based flow, ensuring consistency in branding and clarity in the user journey leading up to the donation.  </p>

      <h2>New Site Map</h2>
      <p>
        After reviewing the original structure of Turtle Island Charity’s website, our team collaborated to reorganize and simplify the navigation. 
        The goal was to create a clearer, more intuitive structure that reflects user priorities and reduces cognitive overload. Each section was refined 
        to align with the organization's needs and ensure a smoother experience for donors, volunteers, and visitors. This site map was a key step in defining 
        our information architecture moving forward, while also informing the layout, navigation, and overall design decisions made throughout the project.

      <p>To provide the client with design flexibility, we created both light and dark mode variations of the website to showcase how each could reflect 
        different tones and branding directions. After reviewing both, the client opted for the light mode, aligning with their vision of a professional, 
        warm, and uplifting user experience. </p>
        
      <p> We also collaborated closely with the client on the visual identity of the site, incorporating color schemes inspired by their turtle logo—rooted in 
        the Indigenous medicine wheel—to ensure cultural resonance and brand consistency. From broader elements like palette and layout to finer design choices 
        such as rounded versus sharp edges, the client was involved in every step of the process. This ensured that the final product was not only functional 
        but also deeply reflective of the organization's values and community. </p>
