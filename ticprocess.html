        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        Turtle Island Charity is a community-led organization rooted in Indigenous knowledge and values. It supports
        Indigenous youth, families, and communities through education, mentorship, and wellness programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        When we began working with Turtle Island Charity, their website lacked visual clarity, intuitive structure,
        and accessibility. The design did not reflect the warmth, energy, or professionalism of the work they were doing
        on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
        The goal was to redesign the website to better reflect their mission of "community care through community care,"
        while also improving usability, navigation, and storytelling for donors, volunteers, and the community.
        </p>

      <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        I led the redesign of Turtle Island Charity’s website from research to deployment. My process began with studying best practices for donation pages, evaluating loading speed, and comparing various payment processors to ensure smooth and secure user transactions. I also conducted research to understand the site’s audience and how they engage with charitable platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on this insight, I developed an updated information architecture and user flow, followed by wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes to define the layout. Throughout the project, I communicated regularly with the client, using a design thinking approach to incorporate feedback and ensure their voice was present in each iteration. The final site was then recreated and fully implemented using Wix.
