      <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        As part of a five-member consulting group in TechConnect, three of which (including myself) took part on the full redesign of Turtle Island Charity’s website. While the project was a 
        team effort, I took a role across multiple stages—from initial research to final implementation. We began with exploring best practices for 
        donation-based websites, analyzing site speed, and evaluating payment processors to ensure a smooth and secure donation experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing from this research, we created the updated information architecture and user flow, and developed wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes 
        to guide the layout and structure. We also maintained regular communication with the client, applying a design thinking approach to ensure that their voice and 
        goals were reflected in every iteration. The final website was fully rebuilt and launched using Wix, aligning with both the organization’s needs and their values.
